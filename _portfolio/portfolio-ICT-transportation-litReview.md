As Informational and Communications Technologies (ICTs) are enabling an increasing amount and better quality of everyday activities to be conducted online, it is a common belief that virtual mobility would challenge existing urban form designed for spatially-separated activities. Meanwhile, scholars are considering the direct impacts ICTs have on transportation. These bring up the questions of to what extent do online services influence travel behaviors and how planning initiatives should address the short- and long- term changes. This literature review finds both indirect and direct influences that ICTs have on travel behaviors in terms of activity-travel and transportation, yet the overall impact remains uncertain. It conducts a framework for further empirical research and provides planning implications regarding the travel behaviors influenced by ICTs.
